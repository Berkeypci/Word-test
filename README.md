# Word Test Game
This is a simple word test game written in Python. The game reads English words from an Excel file, asks the user for their meanings, and keeps track of the user's score.

## Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary packages by running pip install pandas on your command line interface.
Make sure that your Excel file is saved in the same directory as the word_test.py file and is named kelimeler.xlsx.
Run the game by typing python word_test.py on your command line interface.

## Game Rules
The game randomly selects a word from the Excel file.
The user is prompted to enter the English meaning of the word.
If the user's guess is correct, the user scores a point.
If the user's guess is incorrect, the user can try again.
The game continues until the user reaches a score of 20 points.
Once the user reaches a score of 20 points, the game ends and displays a "Daily goal completed!" message.

## Improvements
There are several ways to improve this game, such as adding a timer, keeping track of high scores, and adding a difficulty level. Feel free to make changes and customize the game to your liking.
